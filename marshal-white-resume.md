#### Experience  
##### Thomas Fogarty Winery (Assistant Winemaker)  
April 2013-July 2020  Woodside, CA  

At Thomas Fogarty Winery, I began as a part-time helper and quickly accrued responsibilities and earned a position of trust.  As assistant winemaker, I was one of the most senior employees in the company and had many responsibilities, including:  
- Hiring, training, and supervising staff
- Managing compliance with multiple regulatory agencies, and, by extension, risk assessment and mitigation.
- Managing operations, including designing and implementing workflows and assigning staff for maximum effect.
- Quality assurance, including creating, managing, and interpreting large sets of data.
- Industry and brand ambassadorship, on a limited basis.  
The process of winemaking is fraught with unexpected complications and I developed skill at handling logistical problems as they arose.  I always went above and beyond to maintain the highest standards of quality in our production and operation, and managed our team successfully.
